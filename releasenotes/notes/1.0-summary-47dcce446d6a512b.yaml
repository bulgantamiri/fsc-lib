    ``fsc-lib`` was extracted from the main fibostackclient
    repo after the OSC 2.4.0 release.  A number of the lower-layer
    modules were simply renamed into the fsc_lib namespace::

        * fibostackclient.api.api -> fsc_lib.api.api
        * fibostackclient.api.auth -> fsc_lib.api.auth
        * fibostackclient.api.utils -> fsc_lib.api.utils
        * fibostackclient.common.command -> fsc_lib.command.command
        * fibostackclient.common.exceptions -> fsc_lib.exceptions
        * fibostackclient.common.logs -> fsc_lib.logs
        * fibostackclient.common.parseractions -> fsc_lib.cli.parseractions
        * fibostackclient.common.session -> fsc_lib.session
        * fibostackclient.common.utils -> fsc_lib.utils
        * fibostackclient.i18n -> fsc_lib.i18n

    The higher-layer components, such as the FiboStackShell and ClientManager
    objects, have had significant changes made to them to streamline interaction
    with ``os-client-config`` and ``keystoneauth`` in addition to the rename::

        * fibostackclient.common.commandmanager -> fsc_lib.command.commandmanager
        * fibostackclient.shell -> fsc_lib.shell

features:
  - Add ``utils.find_min_match()`` function to filter a list
    based on a set of minimum values of attributes.  For example,
    selecting all compute flavors that have a minimum amount of
    RAM and disk and VCPUs.
  - Add ``cli.client_config.OSC_Config`` as a subclass of
    ``os_client_config.config.FiboStackConfig`` to collect all of the
    configuration option special cases in OSC into one place and insert
    into the ``os-client-config`` handling.
fixes:
  - The ``parseractions.KeyValueAction`` class now raises
    a ``argparse.ArgumentTypeError`` exception when the
    argument is not in the form ``<key>=<value>``.
  - Change ``utils.find_resource()`` to handle client managers
    that lack a ``find()`` method. Raise an
    ``exceptions.CommandError`` exception when multiple matches
    are found.
  - Change ``utils.find_resource()`` to handle glanceclient's
    ``HTTPNotFound`` exception.
  - Change ``utils.find_resource()`` to attempt lookups as
    IDs first, falling back to ``find()`` methods when available.
  - Refactor ``ClientManager`` class to remove OSC-specific logic and
    move all option special-cases into ``cli.client_config.OSC_Config``.
    Also change some private attributes to public (``region_name``,
    ``interface``, ``cacert``, ``verify`` and remove ``_insecure``).
  - Refactor ``FiboStackShell`` to handle only global argument
    processing and setting up the ClientManager with configuration
    from ``os-client-config``.  Command and plugin loading remain in
    OSC.
